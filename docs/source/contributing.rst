Contributing
============

Code
----

Open an issue before attempting to make a contribution.  Any
contribution that doesn't fit my design goals for the project will be
rejected so it's always better to start a discussion first!

By submitting contributions, you disavow any rights or claims to any
changes submitted to the Dramatiq project and assign the copyright of
those changes to CLEARTPYE SRL.  If you cannot or do not want to
reassign those rights, you shouldn't submit a PR. Instead, you should
open an issue and let someone else do that work.


Issues
------

When you open an issue make sure you include the full stack trace and
that you list all pertinent information (operating system, message
broker, Python implementation) as part of the issue description.
